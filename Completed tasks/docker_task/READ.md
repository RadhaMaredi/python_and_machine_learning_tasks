problem statement:
Deploy a flask app on docker

What is Docker:
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.

For this, I used the flaskAlchemy. Connected to the database and it shows the tables of the users list, here user can perform CRUD(create,read,update and delete) operation. then i created docker image after that created a docker container finally i pushed it into the Docker Hub.
