Time series forecasting:
Time series forecasting occurs when you make scientific predictions based on historical time stamped data. It involves building models through historical analysis and using them to make observations and drive future strategic decision-making.

Univariate time series forecasting:
Univariate analysis is the analysis of one variable.

Multivariate time series forecasting:
Multivariate analysis is the analysis of more than one variable.

Problem statement:
Need to predict the future values over a period of time using time series forecasting with prophet model.

Goal: Identifying the nature of the phenomenon represented by the sequence of observations, and forecasting (predicting future values of the time series variable).

libraries used : fbprophet, datetime, matplotlib, lstm

Approach for Prophet:
1.  importing required libraries
2.  Data pre-processing with time series
3.  model fitting
4.  obtaining and plotting the forecasts
5.  cross validation
6.  computing performance metrics

Approach for LSTM:
1.importing required libraries
2.  Data pre-processing
3.  built the LSTM model
4.  fitting the model
5.  predict the the results
6.  inverse transform
7.  visualize the results
