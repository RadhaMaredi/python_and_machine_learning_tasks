Problem statement:
Detect the person who are wearing mask properly, improperly and no_mask and also find the count of the classes?

Approach:
1.  I collected the images and Prepared dataset and label them in YOLO format using LabelImg. Once done, zipped all the images and their corresponding label files as images.zip.

2.  Created a folder named yolov3 on Google Drive and upload the images.zip file inside it.

3.  Clone the repository and upload the YOLOv3_Custom_Object_Detection.ipynb notebook on Google Colab.

4.  Run the cells one-by-one by following instructions as stated in the notebook. 

5.  Once the training is completed, downloaded the following files from the yolov3 folder saved on Google Drive, into my local machine.

6.  By using the weights file implemented the detection and count of the classes
